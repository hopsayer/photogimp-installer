**PhotoGIMP** is a free, community-driven patch that transforms [GIMP](https://www.gimp.org/) (GNU Image Manipulation Program) into a layout that feels familiar to **Adobe Photoshop** users. If you're switching from Photoshop to GIMP and want to feel at home right away, PhotoGIMP is for you.

> **New to GIMP?** GIMP is a free and open-source image editor available for Linux, macOS, and Windows. It can do most things Photoshop can — photo retouching, image composition, graphic design, and more — all for free. PhotoGIMP just makes it *look and feel* more like Photoshop.

## ✨ Features

- **Photoshop-like tool layout** — Tools are reorganized to mimic the positions you're used to in Adobe Photoshop.
- **Custom Splash Screen** — A unique PhotoGIMP splash screen greets you on startup.
- **Maximized canvas space** — Default settings are optimized to give you the largest possible working area.
- **Photoshop keyboard shortcuts** — Keyboard shortcuts follow [Adobe's official documentation](https://helpx.adobe.com/photoshop/using/default-keyboard-shortcuts.html) for the Windows version.
- **Custom icon & name** — A dedicated `.desktop` file gives PhotoGIMP its own icon and app name in your system menu.

## 📋 Requirements

Before installing PhotoGIMP, make sure you have:

| Requirement | Details |
|---|---|
| **GIMP 3.0 or newer** | Download from: [gimp.org](https://www.gimp.org/downloads/) or [Flathub](https://flathub.org/apps/org.gimp.GIMP) (Linux) |
| **Run GIMP at least once** | GIMP needs to generate its config files before PhotoGIMP can overwrite them. **Install GIMP → open it → close it → then install PhotoGIMP.** |

---

## ⚙ How to Install

> [!WARNING]
> **Back up your current GIMP settings before installing!** PhotoGIMP overwrites GIMP's configuration files. If you have custom settings you want to keep, save a backup copy first. See the backup instructions in each section below.

---

### 🐧 Flatpak (Linux)

<img src="https://skillicons.dev/icons?i=linux" align="right" width="40" />

#### Backup (optional)

If you want to keep your current GIMP settings, back them up first:

```bash
cp -r ~/.config/GIMP/3.0 ~/GIMP-3.0-backup
```

#### Install

1. Make sure you already have GIMP installed [from Flathub](https://flathub.org/apps/org.gimp.GIMP).
2. **Open GIMP once, then close it** — this creates the config folders that PhotoGIMP needs.
3. Download the latest release:
   👉 **[Download PhotoGIMP for Linux (.zip)](https://github.com/Diolinux/PhotoGIMP/releases/download/3.0/PhotoGIMP-linux.zip)**
4. Extract the `.zip` file **into your home folder** (`~`).
   - This will place files into `~/.config` and `~/.local`, which are hidden folders.
   - To see hidden folders in your file manager, press <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>H</kbd>.
   - When prompted about existing files, choose **"Replace"** or **"Overwrite"**.
5. Open GIMP — you should see the new PhotoGIMP layout! 🎉

<details>
<summary><strong>💡 Using a non-Flatpak GIMP?</strong></summary>

If you installed GIMP from your distro's package manager (apt, dnf, pacman, etc.) instead of Flatpak, the config folder is in the same location (`~/.config/GIMP/3.0`), so the steps above still work. Just make sure you have GIMP version 3.0 or newer.

## ❓ Troubleshooting / FAQ

<details>
<summary><strong>PhotoGIMP didn't change anything — GIMP looks the same</strong></summary>

- Make sure you extracted the files to the **correct location**. The most common mistake is extracting to the wrong folder.
- **Linux**: The `.config` and `.local` folders must be in your home directory (`~`). They are hidden — press <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>H</kbd> in your file manager to see them.
- **Windows**: The `3.0` folder must be inside `%APPDATA%\GIMP`, not next to it.
- **macOS**: The `3.0` folder must be inside `~/Library/Application Support/GIMP`.
- Did you **close GIMP** before pasting the files? GIMP may overwrite incoming settings on exit.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>I get an error when opening GIMP after installing PhotoGIMP</strong></summary>

- This usually means the GIMP version doesn't match. PhotoGIMP is built for **GIMP 3.0+**. If you're running GIMP 2.x, it won't be compatible.
- Try deleting the config folder and reinstalling — see the [How to Uninstall](#-how-to-uninstall) section.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Can I use PhotoGIMP with GIMP 2.10?</strong></summary>

No. This version of PhotoGIMP is designed exclusively for **GIMP 3.0 and newer**. The configuration format changed significantly between GIMP 2.x and 3.x.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Will PhotoGIMP delete my custom brushes, fonts, or plug-ins?</strong></summary>

No. PhotoGIMP only replaces configuration files (shortcuts, layout, preferences). Your personal brushes, fonts, gradients, and plug-ins remain untouched.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Can I customize the shortcuts after installing PhotoGIMP?</strong></summary>

Absolutely! PhotoGIMP just sets a starting point. You can change any shortcut in GIMP via **Edit → Keyboard Shortcuts**.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>How do I update PhotoGIMP to a new version?</strong></summary>

Just download the latest release and follow the installation steps again — it will overwrite the previous PhotoGIMP configuration.
</details>
